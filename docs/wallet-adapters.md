# Wallet adapters

Wallet integrations implement `WalletAdapter` in `src/lib/wallet/types.ts` and are registered in `src/lib/wallet/index.ts`.

Adapters must expose connect, disconnect, address, network and transaction signing. Signing always receives the configured network; adapters should throw `WalletAdapterError` with `NETWORK_UNSUPPORTED` when they cannot sign that network. Never persist signed payloads or secret material. Add an install URL and capability flags to the registry, then exercise the adapter contract with a fake wallet in tests.

## Message signing never uses a raw `Keypair`

Production message signing always goes through `buildAuthTransaction` plus a wallet adapter's `signTransaction`; the app never constructs a `Keypair` from a secret. The former `signComment(keypair, payload)` helper in `signMessage.ts` was audited (2026-10-22): it had no call sites outside its own module (`ProposalDetailClient` only imports `signCommentMessage` and `verifySignedComment`), so it was dead code and has been removed. `Keypair.fromPublicKey` remains for signature verification only, which handles no secret material.
